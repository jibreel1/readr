## Overview

### The challenge

Technology is taking over every aspect of the world. E-books are becoming the standard. Studies have shown that having book clubs and reading discussions increases commitments and helps keep you accountable to reading.

So I came up with a project idea that allows you stay consistent with reading by sharing your experiences and progress with other fellow readers. I discovered that having a community for a particular book helps one to concentrate better. This is the idea conceived here.

Users should be able to:

-  Sign up/ Login sucessfully either with the Google sign-in or with the conventional username and password method
-  View the Ebooks page consisting of all the books present in the app
-  Sucessfully search a book title or book author
-  Sucessfully chat with other readers while viewing the ebook you clicked
-  Navigate to the dashboard to view the list of books you are currently reading.

## My process

### Built with

-  Mobile-first workflow
-  [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-  [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - For storing and diplaying my data in Realtime
-  [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - For styles and Carousel display
-  [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
-  [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com/) - For displaying the E-books
-  Context API

### Continued development

I plan to keep improving this app in the future. I will need to understand the concept of Redux as a state management tool for large scale projects. I will also need to undertand Typescript as it makes code cleaner and faster. Moving forward, I want to learn the above to prepare me for my Next.js journey in the nearest future.
